## [Unreleased](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/tree/main)

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/releases/tag/v1.4.1)

### Fixed

- Compilation errors on Rust v1.69.x

### Changed

- Downgrade quork to 0.7.1 to fix compilation error on Rust v1.69.x
  - This downgrades the windows crate to a version that is compatible with the MSRV
- `Manager::new` function is now `pub(crate)`. This makes no difference to the public API, as the `Manager` struct was never public.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

### Added

- `Connected` and `Disconnected` events for when the client successfully connects and disconnects. Thanks to @JakeStanger.

- `EventData` documentation references to reference the `Event` enum instead of `EventData`

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/releases/tag/v1.3.1)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### Breaking Changes

- Send & Receive Loop now breaks for `ConnectionRefused` error kind, rather than `WouldBlock`
- Removed client thread handle (now is kept internally on the Client struct)
- Removed `STARTED` boolean. (Pretty much pointless as it is only different between when the client has been started, but is not yet ready)
- Increase connection timeout on Windows to 16 seconds
- `on_event` now returns an EventCallbackHandle, which, if dropped, removes the event handler

### Added

- Ability to remove event handlers [#40](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/issues/40)
- Support buttons [#38](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/issues/38)
